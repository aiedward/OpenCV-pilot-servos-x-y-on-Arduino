# OpenCV-pilot-servos-x-y-on-Arduino

This small project permit to pilot two servos (pan, tilt) on an Arduino through OpenCV.
OpenCV read the coordinates of a mouse on screen, translate its coordinates to match the min-max values of servos, and pilot them through the serial port.
This project was done under Linux Debian 8.1, OpenCV 3.1, C++ and Arduino.
